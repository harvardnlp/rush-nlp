      title: NamedTensor (Tensor Considered Harmful)
      abstract: Named Tensor is a proposal for adding a new datastructure to mathematical libraries to tread tensors more like dicts and less like tuples. This blog post had the impact of getting PyTorch to add a NamedTensor annotation in v1.3 of the libary.

      title: The Annotated Transformer
      abstract: The annotated transformer was an experiment in blogging based on literate papers. The idea was to teach researchers how an important model in NLP works by aligning the paper line-by-line with an implementation. The blog post was widely distributed, and there have been many follow-ups for new model.
